# Two-Button-Servo-Control-Arduino-with-LCD

This is a basic code and breadboard schematic for 2 button control of a micro servo.

Prior to this code I was unable to find a working code to control a servo motor by incremental control using push buttons
instead of utilizing a potentiometer. This code isn't perfect, but it is functional. The LCD is used to visualize the position
of the servo motor in degrees and to troubleshoot potential problems. 

All aspects of this project are open source, free for anyones use. I just ask that you provide appropriate attribution.
